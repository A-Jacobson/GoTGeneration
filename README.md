# GoTGeneration

Project to generate new Game of Thrones book using LSTM neural networks using the existing 5 books as source material.

## TODO

- explore and visualize GoT word vectors (test R + L = J)

- generate sample GoT chapter from prior books

- generate sample hybrid GoT chapter from prior books and other sci-fantasy text e.g. lord of the rings

- replace proper nouns in other corpus with proper nouns in got and use new corpus to generate text.
